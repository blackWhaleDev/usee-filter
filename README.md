## Documentation


For EXP: you have search page and you want set some filters for that page, 
and this filters should be apply on User class.

first with `artisan` call we create 2 class (Name and LastNameLike):

name:
```bash
php artisan make:filter Name FirstName
```
this command will generate "Name.php" file in "App\QueryFilters" Folder

*Note*: the column that we want make filter on it is "first_name" but we should write it in CamelCase and also
in the HTML form input name should be the same of column name "first_name"

now second class :
```bash
php artisan make:filter LastName LastName --type=like
```
this command will generate "likeLastName.php" file in "App\QueryFilters" Folder

now call `pipe()` helper into your function

```php
pipe(New User(), [
    Name::class,
    likeLastName::class, // --type = like
])->paginate(10);
```
just it ;) !!!

when request come into the helper its go to the Name Class and check if request has "name"
it will be check and if request do not has "name" it will be go to next request (next class) without check
